>Your small raft drifts aimlessly on the windless sea. You see a lantern light pierce the thick fog. The first sign of land some time. It sits on the edge of a worn dock. An old man with a pegleg sits beside it, holding a fishing pole and gazing into the water. When he sees you, he scrambles for a rope and tosses it towards your raft and helps pull you ashore. *"Welcome to Twigport! You're the first thing I've caught in days."*

There's a 4-in-6 chance of foggy weather on any given day.

## Map Locations
### 1. Twigport
A small dreary fishing village with only a handful of remaining residents. Chief fisherman Guernswell says the fishing and hunting has gotten bad since the dragon Zeltiak arrived in the area. As if the wild critters have mostly ran away. Will pay 100gp and hold a festival in the party's honor if they get rid of the dragon.
### 2. Henge
An old necromancer, known as Filthy Eustace, camps under this henge with his 4 zombie guards. He's accidentally raised the dead in the old cemetery (Hex #5) and they wander the land aimlessly. It weighs on his conscience. He will give the party a skeleton hawk familiar if they put the *10 Wandering Skeletons* to rest.

### 3. Stone Circle
An ancient monument to Gordmak, Demon Lord of Laziness. It takes extra effort to perform any action here. -4 to all rolls. A gold idol of Gordmak worth 500gp is buried in the center of the circle.
### 4. Slime Pond
Full of green sticky slime. The glint of gold and gems can be seen at the bottom of the pond in the daytime. A lure set by the 3 carnivorous razor toothed mermaids who lives in the depths. 1d6x100gp worth of jewelry and a magic scroll in a bottle lie in a sack at the bottom of the pond.

### 5. The Old Cemetery
Ancient tombstones inscribed with a forgotten language. Ten graves have been dug up. 5 remain undisturbed. These each contain a skeleton and 1d20 gold coins.
### 6. The Dragon's Cave
Zeltiak the white dragon sleeps here on a pile of bones and 2500gp. Two enthralled ogres serve him, bringing him animals and people to eat as well as more gold. Zeltiak is vain a cruel and enjoys puzzles and riddles. He considers all living creatures a future meal unless convinced otherwise. He desires gold above all and is easily bribed.
