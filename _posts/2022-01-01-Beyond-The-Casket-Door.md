>At an hour only you resurrectionists know, your shovels hit the casket. But you find no body for the surgeons. Instead, stairs... going down.

**A.** Wooden walls. Plush red sofa. Dark coffee table with a lit red candle. Black rug. Large painting of a white cat. Wavering violin music comes from *Room B.*

**B.** A tuxedoed violinist squeals out a dirge. His paper-mâché fingers ripped, his face peeling. His painted expression of joy fading. If forced to stop he crumbles to the ground.

**C.** Twelve paper-mâché dancers waltz sluggishly to the music from *Room B.* They are still if the music is stopped.

**D.** A great feast is laid out on a table. Roasted meat, bread, and fruit. A jewel encrusted gold goblet of wine and a single plate and silverware set is placed in front of a high, plush chair. Two tuxedoed butlers with heads like ants stand beside the chair.

**E.** A white cat lounges on a gold pillow on a marble pedestal. It’s collar reads: *Dantalion.* In a deep voice, it says *“You have misstepped. Take the door behind me.”* If further engaged it will only purr and clean itself. The paper-mâché creatures and butlers will attack any who harm it. The door opens to a dark room. Whoever enters it wakes up the next day by the empty, now normal casket. Anyone who ate from the feast wakes up alone in a coffin six feet under the graveyard. 
*Roll a new character.*
