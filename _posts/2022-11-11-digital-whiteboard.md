I ran a game last night. It was a scifi adventure using [Roder](https://perchance.org/roder) for the rules and the *Abandoned Laboratory* from my Scumguts zine.

I googled 'digital whiteboard' right before the game and used the first one to pop up: [Miro.](https://miro.com/) 
It worked great! Everyone just pasted their character sheet onto sticky notes that can be moved around the board.

Everyone can doodle on the board so the players could map as they played and i could draw on it as well to clarify any misunderstandings or whatever.

And of course there are the doodles that character make during the game.

Their are a lot more features in Miro that I didn't touch. It looks like it has built in video chat but we just did our audio through discord. I'm sure there are more digital whiteboards out there as well. Let me know if you use one.
